# Chilblains-Analysis

## Objective:
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, cutaneous manifestations, notably chilblain-like lesions (CLLs), have been reported. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics and demographic profiles associated with CLLs in COVID-19 patients.

## Methodology:
Data from the American Academy of Dermatology and International League of Dermatologic Societies' COVID-19 dermatology registry was analyzed. The dataset encompassed 1333 cases, of which 672 were identified as having CLLs. A thorough examination of patient demographics, clinical presentations, and therapeutic interventions was undertaken. A comparative analysis was executed between the CLL cohort and other dermatological manifestations of COVID-19. We implemented logistic regression analysis to discern associations between distinct features and CLL incidence. This was enhanced by a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization for feature selection and was further validated using nested-k-fold cross-validation. Moreover, a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the dataset was performed to provide a thorough understanding.

## Key Findings:
The logistic regression pinpointed significant associations between particular clinical characteristics and the emergence of CLLs. Manifestations such as papulosquamous rash and urticarial eruption displayed a reduced association with CLLs. In contrast, foot involvement, a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis, and negative PCR results showed heightened associations with CLL. Notably, presentations such as fever and dermatological findings post COVID-19 treatment initiation exhibited negative correlations with CLLs.

## Conclusion:
The investigation underscores the salience of specific clinical morphologies, diagnostic patterns, location and symptomatic presentations as indicative markers for CLLs. The discerned associations can assist medical professionals in distinguishing CLLs from other dermatological presentations in COVID-19, emphasizing the imperative for subsequent studies to validate these findings and ascertain causative links.
