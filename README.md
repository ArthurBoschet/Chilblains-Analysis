# Chilblains-Analysis

## Objective:
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, cutaneous manifestations, notably chilblain-like lesions (CLLs), have been reported. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics and demographic profiles associated with CLLs in COVID-19 patients.

## Methodology:
Data from the American Academy of Dermatology and International League of Dermatologic Societies' COVID-19 dermatology registry was analyzed. The dataset encompassed 1333 cases, of which 672 were identified as having CLLs. A thorough examination of patient demographics, clinical presentations, and therapeutic interventions was undertaken. A comparative analysis was executed between the CLL cohort and other dermatological manifestations of COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis, supplemented with Bayesian hyperparameter search for feature selection, was employed to ascertain associations between specific features and the incidence of CLLs. Additionally, a descriptive analysis was conducted to offer an exhaustive overview of the dataset.

## Key Findings:
The logistic regression pinpointed significant associations between particular clinical characteristics and the emergence of CLLs. Manifestations such as papulosquamous rash and urticarial eruption displayed a reduced association with CLLs. In contrast, characteristics like foot involvement, presumptive COVID-19 diagnosis based solely on clinical manifestations, and PCR negative results showed heightened associations with CLL. Notably, presentations such as fever and dermatological findings post COVID-19 treatment initiation exhibited negative correlations with CLLs.

## Conclusion:
The investigation underscores the salience of specific clinical morphologies, diagnostic patterns, and locational implications related to COVID-19 testing and symptomatic presentations as indicative markers for CLLs. The discerned associations assist medical professionals in distinguishing CLLs from other dermatological presentations in COVID-19, emphasizing the imperative for subsequent studies to validate these findings and ascertain causative links.
